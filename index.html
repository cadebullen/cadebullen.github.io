                        on CS theoretical concepts. The course topics include sets and logic, proof techniques,

                        recursion, recurrence equations, counting methods (permutations and combinations),
                        basic discrete probability, introduction to number theory, and a brief introduction to

                        efficient, large-scale information storage and rapid retrieval.
                        Databases support the "back end functionality" of most large web systems.
                        This course gives students extensive, pragmatic experience in designing, building, querying,
                        updating, maintaining and managing relational databases, using the Structured Query Language
                        (SQL).
                        Proper database design principles are emphasized throughout the course, beginning with high
                        level descriptions of relational databases using data modeling tools(such as entity-relationship
                        or ER diagrams)
                        and progressing to relational database design principles based on higher order normalizations.
                        We will examine some poorly designed databases and show how these can be transformed into well
                        designed databases.
                        SQL will be extensively covered, and students will design implement sophisticated SQL queries
                        invoking self-joins, outer joins, correlated sub-queries and related concepts.
                        Students will explore and utilize design methodologies for input data validation and maintaining
                        database integrity, and study issues of database privacy and security.
                        Advanced topics to be discussed include the role of the Database Administrator (DBA), database
                        life cycle activities, database de-normalization, read-only database and data warehouses.
                        Hands-on experience will be gained by with actual database using industry-standard database
                        management systems such as Oracle.</td>

                        tailored solutions.
                        They will recognize the value of ongoing professional development and be proficient in using

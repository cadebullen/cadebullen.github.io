                <h1 id="first">Hello, my name is Cade Brandon Bullen. <br> I am currently studying Computer Science. </h1>
                
                I am a student currently looking for an intership or co-op,
                <br> in hopes of earning experience in the tech field. Currently,
                 my main focus of interest is in software engineering 
                - that is either frontend, <br> backend, or full stack. 
                I also hold interests in QA testing, IT, Data Science, and Game Development.

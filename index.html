            Hello all, my name is Cade Brandon Bullen. I am a computer science major currently looking for an intership or co-op,
            <br> in hopes of earning experience in the tech field. Currently, my main focus of interest is in software engineering 
            - that is either frontend, <br> backend, or full stack. I also hold interests in QA testing, IT, Data Science, and Game Development.
